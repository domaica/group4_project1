**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

Access different databases in order to determine the best places or cities in the USA (f.ex. Top 10) to install solar panels or wind turbines (or both) that allow us to produce electricity without having to depend on utility companies.

**QUESTIONS TO ANSWER**

1. Check USA places with biggest solar radiation
2. Plot / Map
3. Check USA places with more wind productivity
4. Plot / Map
5. Check city/county for solar radiation optimum places
6. Check city/county for wind turbines optimum places
7. Check intersection / correlation between both datasets (wind / solar)
8. Decide on whether to make separate choices between solar and wind or a single set depending on the correlation.
9. Get final results
10. Plot in the map

**DATASETS TO BE USED**

It will be necessary to connect through APIs at least the following databases (pending further research):

- OpenWeatherMAPI
- Citipy
- Google Maps
- Windy API
- Maybe USWTDB API
- US Department of Energy

**TASKS Breakdown**

To be determined

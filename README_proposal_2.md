**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

We try to discover what variables determine the best location for renewable energies. 
We will research at least relations between solar radiation, winds, hydro power, elevation and location and try to analyze what's their influence and correlation among those factors.

Access different databases in order to determine the best places or cities in the USA (f.ex. Top 10) to install solar panels or wind turbines (or both) that allow us to produce electricity without having to depend on utility companies.

We do not have a conclusion. The final result will be determined by our analysis.

**QUESTIONS TO ANSWER**

1. Check USA places with biggest solar radiation
2. Plot / Map
3. Check USA places with more wind productivity
4. Plot / Map
5. Check USA places with hydropower (dams) and where are they located
6. Plot / Map
7. Check city/county for solar radiation optimum places
8. Check city/county for wind turbines optimum places
9. Check intersections / correlations 
10. Decide on whether to make separate choices among criteria or a single set depending on the correlation.
11. Get final results/conclusions


**DATASETS TO BE USED**

It will be necessary to connect through APIs at least the following databases (pending further research):

- OpenWeatherMAPI
- Citipy
- Google Maps
- Windy API
- Maybe USWTDB API
- US Department of Energy
- NOAA precipitation per city API for the last 20 years
- Fema.gov Avg. annual flood insurance cost 

**TASKS Breakdown**

- Gibbs on HydroPower
- Amaya on wind
- Domaica on Solar
- Rest to be determined

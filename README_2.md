Project Desciption:
Using  elevation and average precipitation datasets for each city in the United States, we will attempt to discover which city in the US is mostly likely to suffer from a severe flood. Once are top cities are found, we will attempt to validate our findings by comparing it to flood insurance rates throughout the country.

Questions to Answer:
What are the top 10 US Cities that are most likely to experience a severe flood?
Which variables is the strongest determinate for a flood (eg. preciptation or location/elevation?
Is there a relationship between our findings and flood insurance rates throughout the country?

Possible sources of data 
-google elevation API
-NOAA precipitation per city API for the last 20 years
-Fema.gov Avg. annual flood insurance cost
